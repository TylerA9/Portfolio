            <p>
              Hello! I am a 23 year old student at Base Camp Coding Academy
              Graduate Institute. I have been in school since September 2022 and
              so far I have learned a lot including Python, HTML, & CSS. I am
              also working during this time. I am currently a Data Extractor
              Supervisor for a team of five people. When I am not at work or
              school I like to spend my free time either reading some kind of
              fantasy or science fiction book or playing a game.
